# Car Showcase Website

This project is a fully responsive car showcase website built using Bootstrap. Currently, only the Home page has been developed, and navigation to other pages is not yet implemented. The goal of this project is to create an elegant and user-friendly platform to display cars with their details, pricing, and specifications.

## Features (Current Implementation)

### Home Page:
- Responsive design using **Bootstrap 5**.
- Featured cars displayed in a **Carousel**.
- Car categories showcased in a grid layout using **Cards**.
- Clean and modern UI with smooth animations.

## Planned Features
- **About Us Page**: Information about the dealership and services.
- **Car Details Page**: Detailed information about each car (images, specs, price).
- **Contact Us Page**: A form for users to inquire or get in touch.
- **Navigation**: Functional links to all pages in the navbar.

## Technologies Used
- **Bootstrap 5**: For responsive design and pre-built components.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For structure and styling.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements (e.g., Carousel).
- **Font Awesome**: For icons.

## Next Steps
- Create additional pages (`about.html`, `contact.html`, `details.html`).
- Implement navigation links in the navbar to connect all pages.
- Add more interactive features (e.g., filters for car categories).
- Optimize for performance and accessibility.

This project is a work in progress, and contributions or suggestions are welcome! ðŸš—âœ¨
